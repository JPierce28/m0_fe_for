# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
  - I'm still not completely confident but spending extra time tonight has made me feel a lot better about it. Being able to find the information on google and slack helped me tremendously today.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
  - I had both struggles. After spending a lot of time in the Unproductive struggle I decided to go for a long walk to reset. Afterwards I came home and was able to be in a productive struggle and work the the lesson.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  - I still need to practice the "if" part of the statements. It took me a long time to learn the different syntax to use to get the code block to work.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  - I spent a lot of time on this today and I think I was able to answer most of my questions.
